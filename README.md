# Overview

Play a game of Tenzies online! The goal is to get all the dice to the same number.

This is a project from the [Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) from Scrimba.

## Extra features I added

- Created the dots on the face of the dice using CSS including CSS grid
- Track the number of rolls
- Track the time it took to win
- Save the userâ€™s best time to `localStorage`
